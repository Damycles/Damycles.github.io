            Joseph Christian Leyendecker, born in Germany in the year 1874 before quickly moving to 
            Chicago with his family in 1882.

            He began to study art and illustration there before moving to Paris to further hone his
            skills in the 1890s.

            In 1902 Leyendecker relocated to New York to start his career as a commercial artist.
            Leyendecker's work, starting with the "Arrow Collar Man" would go on to redefine the
            aesthetics of men's fashion and beauty for the next few decades.

            A pioneer of the Art Deco movement, Leyendecker's signature style included the usage of
            bold lines, strong shape design, and visible brushwork that added a distinct texture to
            his images.

            But most of all, Leyendecker was highly prised for his ability to tell entire stories
            through single image illustrations alone, a factor that made him highly sought after
            in advertising especially.
